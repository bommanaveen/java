1.
Java program to create a Base class with a method called ‘void 
area(int a, int b)’ which print area of a square. Now override the 
method from Derived class and make it print area of a rectangle.

class Base {

    void area(int a, int b) {
        int area = a * a; 
        System.out.println("Area of square: " + area);
    }
}

class Derived extends Base {
    void area(int a, int b) {
        int area = a * b;
        System.out.println("Area of rectangle: " + area);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Base base = new Base();
        base.area(5, 5); 

        Derived derived = new Derived();
        derived.area(5, 10);
    }
}
