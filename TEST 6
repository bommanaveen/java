1.
Java program to create a Base class with a method called ‘void 
area(int a, int b)’ which print area of a square. Now override the 
method from Derived class and make it print area of a rectangle.

class Base {

    void area(int a, int b) {
        int area = a * a; 
        System.out.println("Area of square: " + area);
    }
}

class Derived extends Base {
    void area(int a, int b) {
        int area = a * b;
        System.out.println("Area of rectangle: " + area);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Base base = new Base();
        base.area(5, 5); 

        Derived derived = new Derived();
        derived.area(5, 10);
    }
}
2
Write java code to overload a method called ‘int sum(int a, int b)’
by the 3 ways.
class Calculator {

    int sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    int sum(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    double sum(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();

        int result1 = calc.sum(10, 20);
        System.out.println("Sum of 10 and 20: " + result1);


        int result2 = calc.sum(10, 20, 30);
        System.out.println("Sum of 10, 20, and 30: " + result2);

        double result3 = calc.sum(10.5, 20.5);
        System.out.println("Sum of 10.5 and 20.5: " + result3);
    }
}
OUT PJUT:
Sum of 10 and 20: 30
Sum of 10, 20, and 30: 60
Sum of 10.5 and 20.5: 31.0
